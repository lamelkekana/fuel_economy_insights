# Fuel-Efficient Cars Analysis (2014-2024)

## 1. General info

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook project focusing on the analysis of fuel-efficient cars from 2014 to 2024. The goal of this analysis is to clean, prepare, and explore data on car fuel economy, identifying key trends, insights, and patterns related to vehicle efficiency.

## 2. Datasets

The dataset used can be found in the repository

## 3. Packages

To carry out all the objectives for this repo, the following necessary dependencies were loaded:

1.Pandas 2.0.3 and Numpy 1.24.3
2.Matplotlib 3.7.2

## 4. Environment
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment for this repo, there are many ways to do this, I have outlined one method below..

**Create the new evironment - you only need to do this once**

```
 # create the conda environment
conda create --name <env>
```

**This is how you activate the virtual environment in a terminal and install the project dependencies**

```
# activate the virtual environment
conda activate <env>
# install the pip package
conda install pip
# install the requirements for this project
pip install -r requirements.txt ```
```
